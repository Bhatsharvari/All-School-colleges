                    Super 30 is a non-profit educational program that offers
                    free coaching classes to economically disadvantaged students
                    in Patna, India. The program is for the JEE Mains and JEE
                    Advanced entrance exams for IITs. The program was founded in
                    2009 by Anand Kumar, a math teacher, and Abhayanand, the
                    former D.G.P of Bihar. The program provides students with
                    free study materials, food, and accommodation. However, the
                    program is only available to a limited number of students,
                    and the selection process is based on merit. The program's
                    vision is to commit to a single, renewed education agenda
                    that is holistic, ambitious, and aspirational, leaving no
                    one behind. Its mission is to transform lives through
                    education, recognizing the important role of education as a
                    main driver of development. Kumar and his school have been
                    the subject of several smear campaigns, some of which have
                    been carried in Indian media sources. His life and work were
                    portrayed in the 2019 film, Super 30, where Kumar is played
                    by Hrithik Roshan
