                talent management, performance management, communication, and
                recruitment. They also learn about HR audits, which involve
                auditing an organization's HR management system, practices,
                policies, and procedures. The goal of an HR audit is to identify
                issues in the management system and find ways to improve it.

                The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN, BScN) also known in
                some countries as a Bachelor of Nursing (BN) or Bachelor of
                Science (BS) with a Major in Nursing is an academic degree in
                the science and principles of nursing, granted by an accredited
                tertiary education provider. The course of study is typically
                three or four years. The difference in degree designation may
                relate to the amount of basic science courses required as part
                of the degree, with BScN and BSN degree curriculums requiring
                completion of more courses on math and natural sciences that are
                more typical of BSc degrees (e.g. calculus, physics, chemistry,
                biology) and BN curriculums more focused on nursing theory,
                nursing process, and teaching versions of general science topics
                that are adapted to be more specific and relevant to nursing
                practice. Nursing school students are generally required to take
                courses in social and behavioral sciences and liberal arts,
                including nutrition, anatomy, chemistry, mathematics, and
                English.
